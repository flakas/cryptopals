# cryptopals crypto challenges

[cryptopals crypto challenges](https://cryptopals.com/) were originally started by [Matasano Security](https://twitter.com/matasano) (now [NCC Group](https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/)) back in 2013 as a private challenge for people to learn more about crypto.
In 2015 all challenges were published [publicly](https://cryptopals.com/)

This repository contains my own solutions to the first few problem sets I got to back in 2014.
