//10. Implement CBC Mode
//In CBC mode, each ciphertext block is added to the next plaintext
//block before the next call to the cipher core.
//
//The first plaintext block, which has no associated previous ciphertext
//block, is added to a "fake 0th ciphertext block" called the IV.
//
//Implement CBC mode by hand by taking the ECB function you just wrote,
//making it encrypt instead of decrypt (verify this by decrypting
//whatever you encrypt to test), and using your XOR function from
//previous exercise.
//
//DO NOT CHEAT AND USE OPENSSL TO DO CBC MODE, EVEN TO VERIFY YOUR
//RESULTS. What's the point of even doing this stuff if you aren't going
//to learn from it?
//
//The buffer at:
//https://gist.github.com/3132976
//is intelligible (somewhat) when CBC decrypted against "YELLOW
//SUBMARINE" with an IV of all ASCII 0 (\x00\x00\x00 &c)
